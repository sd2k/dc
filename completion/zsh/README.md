# Zsh completion for dc

## Installation

### oh-my-zsh

To install when using oh-my-zsh, copy this directory to `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/dc`:

    cp -r . $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/dc

And add `dc` to the `plugins` in your `~/.zshrc`. Example:

    plugins=(dc docker git)

(Make sure docker-compose is either removed from this list, or placed before dc).
